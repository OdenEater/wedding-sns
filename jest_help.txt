                                    jest with `--all` will force Jest to run all
                                    tests instead of running only tests related
                                    to changed files.                     [逵溷⊃]

      --cache                       Whether to use the transform cache. Disable

      --changedFilesWithAncestor    Runs tests related to the current changes
                                    and the changes made in the last commit.
                                    Behaves similarly to `--onlyChanged`. [逵溷⊃]
      --changedSince                Runs tests related to the changes since the
                                    provided branch. If the current branch has
                                    diverged from the given branch, then only
                                    changes made locally will be tested. Behaves

      --clearCache                  Clears the configured Jest cache directory
                                    and then exits. Default directory can be

      --clearMocks                  Automatically clear mock calls, instances,
                                    contexts and results before every test.
                                    Equivalent to calling jest.clearAllMocks()

                                    how to find and execute tests. If no rootDir
                                    is set in the config, the directory
                                    containing the config file is assumed to be
                                    the rootDir for the project. This can also
                                    be a JSON encoded value which Jest will use

                                    executing the test. If the file path matches
                                    any of the patterns, coverage information
                                    will be skipped.                      [驟榊・]

                                    writing coverage reports. Any istanbul
                                    reporter can be used.                 [驟榊・]
      --coverageThreshold           A JSON string with which will be used to
                                    configure minimum threshold enforcement for

      --detectLeaks                 **EXPERIMENTAL**: Detect memory leaks in
                                    tests. After executing a test, it will try
                                    to garbage collect the global object used,
                                    and fail if it was leaked             [逵溷⊃]
      --detectOpenHandles           Print out remaining open handles preventing
                                    Jest from exiting at the end of a test run.
                                    Implies `runInBand`.                  [逵溷⊃]

                                    function. This method receives a list of
                                    tests which can be manipulated to exclude
                                    tests from running. Especially useful when
                                    used in conjunction with a testing
                                    infrastructure to filter known broken tests.

                                    Useful for pre-commit hook integration to
                                    run the minimal amount of tests necessary.

                                    completed running. This is useful when

      --json                        Prints the test results in JSON. This mode
                                    will send all other test output and user

      --logHeapUsage                Logs the heap usage after every test. Useful
                                    to debug memory leaks. Use together with
                                    `--runInBand` and `--expose-gc` in node.
                                                                          [逵溷⊃]

      --moduleFileExtensions        An array of file extensions your modules
